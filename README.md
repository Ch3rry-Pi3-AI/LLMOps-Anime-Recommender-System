Absolutely — here’s a clean, accurate adaptation of your **Initial Project Setup README**, rewritten for your **LLMOps Anime Recommender System** and reflecting only the components you’ve actually described:

# 🏗️ **Initial Project Setup — LLMOps Anime Recommender System**

This branch establishes the **foundational structure** for the **LLMOps Anime Recommender System**.
It sets up a **modular Python codebase**, configures dependency management with **`uv`**, and prepares the repository for subsequent stages — including **data processing**, **pipeline development**, and the eventual **Streamlit app** for interactive anime recommendations.

## ⚙️ **Setup Process**

The following steps describe how the initial environment and project structure were created.

### 1️⃣ Create the Project Structure

Directories were organised to maintain **clarity**, **reusability**, and **scalability**, with dedicated folders for configuration, utilities, pipelines, and future application code.

```bash
mkdir -p app/app config data pipeline src utils
touch config/config.py utils/__init__.py
```

Two key utility modules were added inside `utils/`:

* `custom_exception.py` — Provides consistent, contextual error handling across the codebase.
* `logger.py` — Implements timestamped logging for traceability and debugging.

### 2️⃣ Create and Activate the Virtual Environment (with `uv`)

The project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reproducible Python environment management.

Create a Python 3.12 virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

Activate the environment:

* **Windows (cmd):**

  ```cmd
  .\.venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **PowerShell:**

  ```powershell
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```
* **macOS / Linux:**

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3️⃣ Define and Install Dependencies

An initial `requirements.txt` file was created for early experimentation and data handling:

```text
pandas
numpy
python-dotenv
streamlit
```

Install dependencies and generate a lock file:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv lock
```

### 4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

A `.env` file was created in the project root to securely store API credentials:

```text
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key_here
```

These variables are automatically loaded by `config/config.py`.

### 5️⃣ Define Project Metadata

The `pyproject.toml` file centralises metadata and dependency information:

```toml
[project]
name = "llmops-anime-recommender-system"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An LLMOps project for building an anime recommendation system powered by large language models."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = []
```

The `uv.lock` file ensures dependency versions remain consistent across all environments.

### 6️⃣ Install the Project in Editable Mode

Install the project locally in editable mode so updates in code are automatically reflected:

```bash
uv pip install --editable .
```

You should see output confirming successful installation of the package.

## 🧩 Integration Guidelines

| Folder      | Purpose                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/app/`  | Future Streamlit app for the recommender system interface.            |
| `config/`   | Loads `.env` variables and defines project-wide constants.            |
| `data/`     | Contains the dataset used for model development and evaluation.       |
| `pipeline/` | Placeholder for data flow and LLM-based recommendation pipelines.     |
| `src/`      | Reserved for future core modules (e.g., preprocessing or embeddings). |
| `utils/`    | Core utilities for logging and exception handling.                    |

✅ **In summary:**

This setup establishes a **clean, modular foundation** for the **LLMOps Anime Recommender System**, providing:

* Structured environment configuration
* Robust utility modules
* Reproducible dependency management via `uv`

The project is now ready for the next stage — **data processing and LLM pipeline development** leading up to the Streamlit-powered anime recommender interface.
